 Gold Parser Engine (c) 2002 Manuel Astudillo
 --------------------------------------------

 This is a C++ implementation of the gold parser
 engine.
 At this moment the only documentation available
 are the sources and a simple test program.

 Project files for .NET and VC6 are provided, and the
 sources can be compiled under linux without any problems, 
 but complete Makefiles are not provided yet.

 The use is though pretty simple and looking at the
 sources should be enought to understand how it works.
